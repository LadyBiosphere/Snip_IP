			<h3>We support Charities and our Community</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>Our team is passionate about supporting and raising money for the local community and charities. Whether it be shaving heads or cutting off long locks of hair, we love to help!</p>
			<p>For shaves, we can host you at our salon on <a href="index.php?page=contact">The Terrace</a>, or will happily visit you at your place! For those long locks, we cut them off and send them away to be made into wigs for those who need extra hair; the 'payment' for this contributes as a donation to the charity of your choice! Pretty cool, right?</p>
			<p>Interested in having SNIP join you for a shave? Want to bring in your tresses for a chop? 
			<a href="index.php?page=contact">Contact us</a> for a chat!</p>
